## Payment Cycle
For a payment transaction we have to request a payment. If our request is successful the IPG will return a token with which we should guide the customer to the payment page via a GET request.
As the payment gateway requires the request have a valid referer we should do the redirection through an HTML form submission.
Customer will be redirected back to our desired URL(redirect address) from payment page via a POST request carrying data which may be used to check and verify the transaction.

### Instantiating an IPG object
for instantiating an IPG object we should call `Dizatech\SadadIpg\SadadIpg` constructor passing it an array of required arguments containing:
* merchant_id: your payment gateway merchant id
* terminal_id: your payment gateway terminal id
* key: your payment gateway key
#### Code sample:
```php
$args = [
    'merchant_id'   => '123',
    'terminal_id'   => '456',
    'key'           => '789',
]; //Replace arguments with your gateway actual values 
$ipg = new Dizatech\SadadIpg\SadadIpg($args);
```
### Purchase Request
For a payment transaction we should request a payment from IPG and acquire a token. This may be accomplished by calling `requestPayment` method. If the request is successful we can redirect our customer to the payment page with the acquired token.
#### Arguments:
* order_id: unique order id
* amount: payment amount in Rials
* redirect_url: URL to which customer may be redirected after payment
#### Returns:
An object with the following properties:
* status: `success` or `error`
* token: in case of a successful request contains a token with which we can redirect user to the payment page. This token may be used for further tracking the purchase request
* message: in case of an error contains an message describing the error
```php
$result = $ipg->requestPayment(
    order_id: 3,
    amount: 13000,
    redirect_url: 'http://myaddress.com/verify'
);
if ($result->status == 'success') {
    echo "<form action='https://sadad.shaparak.ir/VPG/Purchase' id='sadad_redirect_form' style='display: none;'>
        <input type='text' name='token' value='{$result->token}'>
        <button type='submit'>Send</button>
    </form>
    <script>window.addEventListener('load', function () {document.getElementById('sadad_redirect_form').submit()})</script>";
    exit;
}
```
## Payment verification
After payment the customer will be redirected back to the redirect address provided in payment request, via a POST request carrying all necessary data. Data fields sent by IPG are:
* OrderId: order id passed to IPG when requesting a payment
* ResCode: a code which determines transaction status
* token: payment token (the same acquired when requesting a payment)
If `ResCode` equals `0` and POST request contains a token  we can continue verifying the payment via calling the ipg `verify` method.
#### Arguments:
* token: payment token (returned via the POST request from IPG)
#### Returns:
* status: `success` or `error`
* ref_no: in case of a successful request contains a payment reference number
* message: in case of an error contains an message describing the error
If `ResCode` equals `0` it means the transaction has been successful and verified. `ResCode = 100` means the transaction was successful but has already beeen verified. So in either case the transaction can be regarded as **successful**.
Other values for `ResCode` means the transaction has failed.
#### Code Sample:
```php
//Replace arguments with your gateway actual values 
$ipg = new SadadIpg([
    'merchant_id'   => '123',
    'terminal_id'   => '456',
    'key'           => '789',
]);

if (0 == $_REQUEST['ResCode'] && isset($_REQUEST['token'])) {
    $result = $ipg->verify($_REQUEST['token']);
    if ($result->status == 'success') {
        echo "Transaction sucessful! Reference Number: {$result->ref_no}";
    } else {
        echo "Transaction failed with error: {$result->error}";
    }
}
```
